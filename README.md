# blackjack
C/C++ project: The Blackjack cardgame

Initial files were from Feb/2020, very badly mixed C/C++ code.

Hopefully I can improve it :^)

# Problems / To fix
- Error with 'Input checker' in Menu() and PlayerTurn()
- Platform independent (Linux only atm)
- Improve UI: remove system(...), duplicate std::cout

- TBD

# Fixed
- Modularity: separate obj files
- Commenting
- Remove mixture of C code
- Play option [1]'s working
- Logic for Dealer's hand reveal
