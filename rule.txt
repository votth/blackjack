---- Blackjack Simulator's Guidline ----
----------------------------------------

!!!The simulator's rule is different compare to the IRL Blackjack, please read carefully!!!

---- OBJECT OF THE GAME ----
Each participant attempts to beat the dealer by getting a count as close to 21 as possible, without going over.
In this game, there will be 4 players going up against a single auto-generated DEALER, the odd is in your flavour!

---- CARD VALUES/SCORING ----
Aces are 11 points, face-cards are 10 and any other cards are its pip value.

---- THE DEAL ----
The dealer gives one card face up to each player in rotation clockwise, and then one card face up to himself.
Another round of cards is then dealt face up to each player, but the dealer takes his second card face down.
Thus, each player except the dealer receives two cards face up, and the dealer receives one card face up and one card face down.

---- NATURALS ----
If a player's first two cards are an ace and a "ten-card" (a picture card or 10), giving him a count of 21 in two cards.
This is a natural or "blackjack". That player will win immediately.

---- THE PLAY ----
The player to the left goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card)
or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly).
Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt for him, or he may ask the dealer for additional cards, one at a time.
Until he either decides to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), or goes "bust" (if it is over 21).
In the latter case, the player loses.

The dealer then turns to the next player to his left and serves him in the same manner.

---- THE DEALER'S PLAY ----
When the dealer has served every player, his face-down card is turned up.
If the total is 17 or more, he must stand.
If the total is 16 or under, he must take a card, and continue doing so.
Until the total is 17 or more, at which point the dealer must stand.

The dealer's decisions, then, are automatic on all plays, whereas the player always has the option of taking one or more cards.

That's all, now head out and start playing, remember to enjoy yourself!!!
